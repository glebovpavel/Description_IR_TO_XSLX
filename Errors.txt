Control Break settings are not supported - column "Assigned to" displayed as normal column.

Incorrect strings support - leading zero-symbols are lost

What is this nonsense ???

Dates are represented as character strings - no correct date comparison, calculation etc.

Numbers are represented as character strings - no summing, calculation, aggregation etc.

Where are my Aggregations ?
